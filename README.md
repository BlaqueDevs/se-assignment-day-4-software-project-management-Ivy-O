# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management

Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met? Timely delivery ensures that project goals are achieved as expected and any issues that arise fixed as the project progresses. Managers can assure that deadlines are met by monitoring progress continuously. 
How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns? Cost control minimises overshots in what can be achieved and how that translates to profit after launching, if the cost is too high the return might not be worthy, Sticking to the initial budget can ensure overruns are minimised.
Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each? Agile is flexible and whole rounded it means different parts of the project can be worked on then brought together while Waterfall requires for a more linear approach that might take more time since each step has to be worked on as you move to the next,  
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? Building a website can work with agile since you can have some of the basics down and keep adding to the project while building an LMS needs a waterfall approach because the flow of knowledge base and content has to flow.
What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Requirements Analysis  and Clear Documentation this documents testable requirements.
Why is it important to maintain high standards? High standards ensure efficiency because it results in reliability, cost effectiveness, scalability, client satisfaction there is no downside to having a high standard
How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful? Defining a project scope helps set the goals, needs, requirements, strategies and all that is needed to realise the project and having a WBS will help break these into tasks and smaller achievable goals.
What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?  Detailed project schedule is like a roadmap that guides taks and when they need to be done Gantt charts helps visualise this roadmap that can easily be followed.
What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? Bridging the gap between employers and employees who are skilled but did not go through institutions to get there. This problems are significant to my target audience because they make a large percent of the labourforce that is out here.
How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution? The more specific the problem, the more specific the solution will be.
How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details? Bring forward the Kenyan skilled labour force.
What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out? Access and user friendliness 
What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software? As of 2019, approximately 3.5% of Kenya's population had completed university education, while an additional 7% had finished middle-level or technical and vocational training (TVET) after secondary school. 
These statistics highlight the need for aligning educational programs with labor market demands to ensure that more Kenyans acquire the necessary skills and qualifications for available job opportunities.

How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development? It will help me get to my target audience quickly and bridge that gap
